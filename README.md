# KivyMediaCenter

[![Codeship](https://img.shields.io/codeship/d6c1ddd0-16a3-0132-5f85-2e35c05e22b1.svg)]()

This is a simple personal project for building with the python library Kivy.
This media center highlights examples in using:
    -Audio
    -Multiple screens
    -Basic .kv file integration

Sadly I...misplaced some of the folders this project utilizes.  Until those are uploaded, this project is broken.
